This is the solution using node.
It is faster than my last program, but there is no big difference. The difficulty for me is creating answers in the form of nodes, regardless how I solve the sum problem. Now I can only use recursion to create such Nodes from a list of numbers, so maybe I should learn some other methods to solve such problems, such as loop.
Below are my solution:
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def newNode(self, fromNode = ListNode(), aList = []):   #Create nodes
        if aList:
            nextNode = ListNode(aList.pop(), fromNode)
            return self.newNode(nextNode, aList)
        else:
            return fromNode
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        answerList = []
        plus = False
        while True:
            a = b = 0   #if the node is Node, than this default will take place of the node.val
            if l1 != None:
                a = l1.val
            if l2 != None:
                b = l2.val
            if plus == True:
                answer = a + b + 1
                plus = False
            else:
                answer = a + b
            if answer >= 10:
                answerList.append(answer - 10)
                plus = True
            else:
                answerList.append(answer)
            if l1 == None:
                pass
            else:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2 == None:
                pass
            else:
                l2 = l2.next
            if l1 == None and l2 == None:
                if plus == True:
                    answerList.append(1)   #add another digit if last sum is larger or equal to 10
                return self.newNode(None, answerList)
```

### Debug process
During debug process, I found that no matter what the answer is, my node always starts with 0, which is nonsense.
After going through the program, I realize that the default value of the node is 0, which I used it as the start of the nodes. Solution: I changed the start of the nodes to None, and solved the problem.
