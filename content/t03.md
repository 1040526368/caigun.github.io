### Task
Given a list containing integers and a integer target value.
You are required to find two integers in this list which sum equals to the target value, and return their index. Suppose that every input will only lead to one answer, but no repeated occurance of one element in the list.
(Problem from Leetcode)

### Analysis
This is easy to write regardless of the time complexity. We can go through every element in the list and combine them and test whether the sums equal to the target value.
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            pivot = i + 1
            while pivot < len(nums):
                    return  [i,pivot]
                else:
                    pivot += 1
```
The time complexity is O(n^2).

### Advanced Task
Find a solution whose time complexity is less than O(n^2).

### Advanced Task Analysis
When looking at the method I used above, it seems to be very similar to the sort method. So I am thinking to make the solution similar to the quick sort, which can make the time complexity lower to less than O(n^2), and I think it can be O(nlogn).
Than I find that if the list is sorted, then it can be easily done by compare the sum with the target value from two side of the list.

If the list is sorted, we can use this method to find the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        lpivot = 0
        rpivot = len(nums)-1
        while nums[lpivot] + nums[rpivot] != target:
            while nums[lpivot] + nums[rpivot] < target:
                lpivot += 1
            if nums[lpivot] + nums[rpivot] == target:
                return [lpivot, rpivot]
            else:
                lpivot = 0
                rpivot -= 1
        return [lpivot, rpivot]
```
But if we use the function list.sort(), the index of the element will change, and thus make the result not accurate. One solution for this problem is that we get the result and then go back the original list and just search for the element and return the index. But when the list contains identical value elements, the program will return the same index, which is not allowed. So I use for loop to go through the element, so that we can find another target element.

### Advanced Task Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumElement(self, nums: list[int], target: int):
        nums1 = nums[:]
        nums1.sort()
        lpivot = 0
        rpivot = len(nums1)-1
        while nums1[lpivot] + nums1[rpivot] != target:
            while nums1[lpivot] + nums1[rpivot] < target:
                lpivot += 1
            if nums1[lpivot] + nums1[rpivot] == target:
                return [nums1[lpivot], nums1[rpivot]]
            else:
                lpivot = 0
                rpivot -= 1
        return [nums1[lpivot], nums1[rpivot]]
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        result = self.twoSumElement(nums, target)
        l, r = False, False
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == result[0] and l == False:
                result[0] = i 
                l = True
            elif nums[i] == result[1] and r == False:
                result[1] = i
                r = True
        return result
```
