# Caigun's Notes
## VSC library is not the direct library

Python

When running python program and debug on the VSC platform, I found that all the new file that the program create will exist in the root directory, 
but not the program's direct library.


To solve this problem, I added `"cwd": "${fileDirname}"` to the config file `.vscode/launch.json` and set the library to be direct to the program.
