Introduction

This is the first blog I write. I am intended to write this blog to record my learning process of coding. I learnt python at the very beginning, and recently I have started learning C. I am only taking formal Python lessons from the University while watching video clips of teaching C languages. So I may write down my working process dealing with the python project problem ,and for C language contents may only contain notes or some simple practices.

```markdown
print('Hello world!')
```

```markdown
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello world!");
    return 0;
}
```
